# Transfer Value Prediction Algorithm

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a Maching Learning Algorithm that was trained using a personalised data set to predict football player's transfer values. The data set was made using data from the Football Manager game, such as attributes and values. By using this, I managed to create an algorithm that was able to predict these values and was also tested on a differet data set.
